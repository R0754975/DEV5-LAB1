    <h2>What do you think of Development 5?</h2>
    <p>Development 5 wasn't necessarily the subject we were looking forward to the most once we knew that IMD would change. The class today still managed to inspire us and make us want to start with it, just like last year.
    </p>

    <h2>What are you looking forward to?</h2>
    <p>
        We really look forward to creating things in 3D and how to make reflections and lighting on a 3D object. Also being able to know how games work and how to work with API's is something that will always be useful.

    </p>

    <h2>What are you afraid of ?</h2>
    <p>
        Everything will be interesting, but we are kind of scared that our vision of this subject might be a bit too positive and not very realistic. We think it will be much tougher and harder than we think and that it will occupy more time than we were expecting.
